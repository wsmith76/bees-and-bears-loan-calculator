# Loan Calculators
This repository contains two separate applications:
1.  A RESTFul API, written in Python using Django, to store customers and loan offer data, and;
2. A single page React web application to calculate monthly payments based on loan amounts, loan terms, and interest rates entered by the user.

Note that the React app is designed to work independently, as the calculations it is being called upon to make can be performed using front-end code.  Details about each of the two applications can be found in the readme.md files located in their respective directories.
